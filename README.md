# NLP Specialization Labs by DeepLearning.AI

This repository contains my solutions and implementations of the lab assignments from the [Natural Language Processing (NLP) Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing) by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera. The specialization is taught by Andrew Ng and Younes Bensouda Mourri and provides a comprehensive introduction to modern NLP techniques.

## ðŸŒŸ **Specialization Overview**

The NLP Specialization consists of four courses:
1. **Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces**
2. **Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models**
3. **Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models**
4. **Natural Language Processing with Attention Models**
